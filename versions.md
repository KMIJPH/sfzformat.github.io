## SFZ v1

The first version of the format was originally published on the [rgc:audio website],
which is the most supported by sfz related software.

## SFZ v2

The SFZ v2 standard has never been clearly set down anywhere.
For the purpose of this website, anything included in the [SFZ v2 regression
tests] is considered SFZ v2, regardless of which SFZ players it might or might
not be actually implemented in. If something works in both ARIA and Cakewalk,
then it's also considered SFZ v2 on this website, though it might not be an
official, de jure standard. If something works in a Cakewalk product, such as
Rapture, but not in ARIA thatâ€™s considered a Cakewalk extension. If something
works in ARIA but not in any Cakewalk products, that's considered an ARIA extension.

The Simon Cann's [Cakewalk Synthesizers] is not a recent book,
and was not intended to be a standards document, but rather a manual
for users of Cakewalk products. So, if you are developing a new SFZ player,
do not feel obligated to support [all opcodes] listed in this website -
instead, use your judgment.

## Extensions

### ARIA

ARIA also adds some [extended MIDI CCs] in addition to those already added
by SFZ 2, and [XML instrument banks] as a way of organizing multiple
SFZ instruments and configuring graphical user interfaces.
