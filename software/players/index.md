There are several SFZ players, which are used to play samples as defined in SFZ
files.

Sforzando currently offers the most complete SFZ standard support, including
[ARIA extensions], but SFZ files which only use the [SFZ v1] or [SFZ v2] standard
will work with multiple SFZ players.

We use "Free and Open Source" (FOSS) as defined by the [OSI]
as "software to be freely used, modified, and shared."
