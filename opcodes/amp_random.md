Computed when the note is triggered,
remains the same for that region for as long as the region plays.

In ARIA and Cakewalk, amp_random is unipolar. To create variation which can
be either negative or positive, this needs to be combined with a fixed
[volume](/opcodes/volume) offset for half the negative value that amp_random
is set to.

In the rgc sfz player, amp_random is bipolar.

## Examples

```
amp_random=10

amp_random=3

volume=-3 amp_random=6
```
